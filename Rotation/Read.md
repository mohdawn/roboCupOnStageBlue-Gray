# 🏙️ Rotating Structure Robot — Timed Motion Module

## 🌍 Project Context

As part of the **Birds of Diversity** robotics showcase, this robot simulates a **building or static object** that **rotates 180 degrees** during the performance. It acts as a supporting element within a larger scene involving character robots (like birds representing different countries) to symbolize **cultural evolution, transformation, or architectural symbolism**.

---

## 🌀 Description

This robot performs a **one-time 180-degree turn** after a timed delay of **110 seconds** from start. The motion is synchronized with a stage sequence, such as:

* Revealing a new section of the set,
* Responding to a bird robot’s movement,
* Simulating a rotating building or structure.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* **Simple Time-Triggered Behavior**: Rotates exactly once based on a timer.
* **Two-Wheel Turning System**: One wheel moves forward while the other moves backward to pivot in place.
* **Compact Motor Control**: Minimalist setup using 5 motor driver pins.
